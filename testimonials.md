<p>Victor Nino and his team was once again wonderful and such a professional to work with! This is our second time he has guided our family in the home process, except this time we were the sellers. Many things stood out to us while working with him. From the beginning he suggested Gina to help stage our home to optimize our profits (which we got asking price), he was calm and collected when dealing with the buyers realtor and our own stress, and when our personal cleaning service was a no show he swooped in with his own person and got the job done! He was able to make the deal happen and be there every step of the way! We are incredibly grateful and look forward to using Victor and his stellar team again during our home buying process soon!</p>

<p>I chose Victor Nino to list and sell my home because of his reputation for selling homes quickly and getting asking price or above. He and his team of real estate professionals were friendly and responsive whenever I had questions or when issues arose during the sales process. They made my home stand out from the competition by staging it and taking professional photos after providing tips on painting and renovating it. In addition, he went out of his way to make life easier on me due to my busy work schedule by including a home cleaning and landscaping session. All of this made my home even more appealing during showings and walkthroughs. I was happy with the end results after selling my home for asking price within the expected time frame. I would highly recommend him to any friends and family members looking to buy or sell a home in the greater Austin area!</p>

<p>Our family worked with Victor and his team on 3 occasions, in the capacity of both buyer and seller. You will not find a more driven, professional, and courteous team anywhere! Not only are they always available when you need them, they will worker harder than anyone to sell your home or help you purchase a new one, and get fast, amazing results, even where others have been unable to do so. We have trusted them with our friends and they gave them the same results and treatment as they gave us. Why hire just a realtor when you can hire a team of professionals who will treat you like family? From staging to closing, they've got you covered. When you are buying, no one will work harder to get you the right deal. Call them today!</p>

<p>We were thankful to have worked with Victor and his team on helping us find (and close on!) our very first home. From the very beginning, he was just on top of EVERYTHING. He was patient, kind, and most off all listened to what we needed. He was always available and guided us in the right direction. If you are thinking of buying or selling a house, I'd definitely recommend him!
