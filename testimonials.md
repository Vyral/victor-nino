<p>Victor Nino and his team was once again wonderful and such a professional to work with! This is our second time he has guided our family in the home process, except this time we were the sellers. Many things stood out to us while working with him. From the beginning he suggested Gina to help stage our home to optimize our profits (which we got asking price), he was calm and collected when dealing with the buyers realtor and our own stress, and when our personal cleaning service was a no show he swooped in with his own person and got the job done! He was able to make the deal happen and be there every step of the way! We are incredibly grateful and look forward to using Victor and his stellar team again during our home buying process soon!</p>

<p>I chose Victor Nino to list and sell my home because of his reputation for selling homes quickly and getting asking price or above. He and his team of real estate professionals were friendly and responsive whenever I had questions or when issues arose during the sales process. They made my home stand out from the competition by staging it and taking professional photos after providing tips on painting and renovating it. In addition, he went out of his way to make life easier on me due to my busy work schedule by including a home cleaning and landscaping session. All of this made my home even more appealing during showings and walkthroughs. I was happy with the end results after selling my home for asking price within the expected time frame. I would highly recommend him to any friends and family members looking to buy or sell a home in the greater Austin area!</p>

<p>Our family worked with Victor and his team on 3 occasions, in the capacity of both buyer and seller. You will not find a more driven, professional, and courteous team anywhere! Not only are they always available when you need them, they will worker harder than anyone to sell your home or help you purchase a new one, and get fast, amazing results, even where others have been unable to do so. We have trusted them with our friends and they gave them the same results and treatment as they gave us. Why hire just a realtor when you can hire a team of professionals who will treat you like family? From staging to closing, they've got you covered. When you are buying, no one will work harder to get you the right deal. Call them today!</p>

<p>We were thankful to have worked with Victor and his team on helping us find (and close on!) our very first home. From the very beginning, he was just on top of EVERYTHING. He was patient, kind, and most off all listened to what we needed. He was always available and guided us in the right direction. If you are thinking of buying or selling a house, I'd definitely recommend him!

<p>If you and your family are looking for a home to buy or sell then look no further. I would like to share our story about how Victor Ni単o and his team helped me and my wife sell our home.
We bought a home in New Braunfels, in 2005 but moved later that year for a job offer in Washington State. We rented our home to various tenants but with the distance between here and Texas, it became too difficult to manage. Our last tenant notified us that they were moving out and my wife and I decided that it was time to quit being out of state landlords. We contacted Victor and he accepted us as clients immediately and began assisting us with a plan to sell our house. The last tenant left the house in a less than desirable condition and this area is one that my wife and I feel makes Victor and his team so special. Ms. Blanca Monarrez Fematt began assisting us with locating expert home cleaners, painting and lawn care professionals, as well as a highly recommended carpet installation expert. Another area that we feel allowed us to get our asking price was the outstanding home staging provided by Gina Ross. The home looked amazing! I couldn't believe that this was our home. It looked like it was staged for a magazine photo shoot.
The professional photographer was great and did excellent work. With all of the great work done by these professionals our home was under contract within 3 weeks!
Another area that also made us feel at ease was his constant open line of communication. Living out of state and having a 2 hour time difference, we had many questions. Victor and Blanca always took the time out of their busy schedules to call us back and put us at ease, no matter how silly our question.
To me and my wife, this is the type of assistance that made the whole process that much easier and why we will recommend Victor and the Keller Williams team to anyone that is selling or buying a home or property across the country.
We are lucky and extremely proud to be a part of the Victor Ni単o, Keller Williams family of friends.

<p>Victor has helped us now with one sale and two home purchases. What impressed us most is his ability to negotiate well yet not jeopardize the buyer/seller. Also, it isn't just Victor...he has a team that includes other realtors as well as an office manager/loan coordinator. Indeed, a true real estate professional!</p>
