Today we’re going to review the latest happenings in our Austin real estate market and see how our present numbers compare to the recent past.&nbsp;

Let’s take a closer look:&nbsp;

Going into this month, we had 1,087 homes already listed, we added 832 brand-new listings, and 771 sales are pending.

With 1.4 months’ worth of inventory, we’re still squarely in a seller’s market. Still, **sellers would be wise to price their home according to market conditions or risk having their home languish on the market for longer than the norm,** **which is 52 days on market.** A home that goes unsold for long periods of time is a home that nets less money when it does eventually sell.&nbsp;

Interest rates were perched at about 5.25% this past December, but they’ve since come down to about 4.25%. Though it may not seem like much, **a dropoff of this size makes a big difference in buyer affordability.&nbsp;**

Although inventory is low, **the recent decrease in interest rates gives buyers a prime opportunity to secure a historically low rate on a home.**&nbsp;

If you’re thinking about selling, there’s a lot to gain considering the current rates as well. **Your pool of buyers will swell with increased affordability, but that pool will thin out when rates begin to increase again, and that translates to a lower sale price on your home.&nbsp;**

If you’re ready to either buy or sell a home soon, please contact me. I’d be more than happy to see how I can be of assistance!&nbsp;
