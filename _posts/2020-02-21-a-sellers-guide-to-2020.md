<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you plan on selling your home this year, you’ll want to first make sure you draft a solid game plan that covers the why, the when, and the how of your home sale.</em></p>

The key to successfully selling in 2020 is to have the appropriate timeline. By what date would you like to have the profits from your home sale in your pocket (i.e., the paperwork’s been signed and the money has been deposited into your account)?&nbsp;

Before you create a timeline, however, **you need to know how long will it most likely take for a home to sell in your subdivision.** The first thing I would do is contact a real estate professional who can provide accurate, detailed information like the average the days on market for your subdivision. Of course, it will matter greatly whether you price your home to sell or commit the common mistake of overpricing.&nbsp;

Understand what days on market actually means, too. For example, 30 days means that, from the time your home goes live on the market to the time it goes under contract, 30 days will have passed. Typically, it takes about four to six weeks for a home to officially close after it goes under contract.&nbsp;

Next, assess your moving plans. Will you be needing a leaseback? Have you set up a temporary housing situation? Write these plans out so that there’s absolute clarity.&nbsp;

How much do you currently own on your home? Do you have any liens on it? Know this information before listing. Your trusted Realtor should connect you with their title team so you can easily review that information. The last thing you’d want is to go under contract only to find out that there’s a lien on your current home from a roofing job done a while back.&nbsp;

When it comes to deciding whether you should hire a real estate agent or go it alone, I’ll say this: **Great work is not cheap, and cheap work is not great.** Everyone knows that defending yourself in court (after many late nights skimming law books) is not the same as being represented by a licensed attorney. It’s no different when it comes to real estate.&nbsp;

Your home sale will likely involve the biggest sum of money you’ll ever handle, so you want an agent who can help you keep the largest profit. Their expertise can also help you avoid troublespots along the way. They’ll know which repairs are necessary and which are a waste of time and money.&nbsp;

Here’s the bottomline: **If you plan ahead and take the time to prepare your home, you will not be anywhere near as stressed as if you wait until the last minute.**&nbsp;

If you don’t have a real estate agent that you trust, let’s sit down and go over your options. I’d love to help you figure out what specific things you need to do to sell your home for top dollar in the quickest amount of time.
