If you’re a homebuyer in the Austin area, you’re always better off having an agent represent you than trying to buy on your own.&nbsp;

Some buyers are under the impression that if they just contact the listing agent of the house they’re interested in, they might get a better deal, but I’ll let you in on a little secret: **Once the listing agent puts that “For Sale” sign in the yard, they’ve already made an agreement with the seller regarding how much commission they’ll pay.&nbsp;**

This means that, if you purchase that house without your own agent, the listing agent will make 2x the commission at closing, and you’ll probably pay the full list price or more because you didn’t have anyone negotiating on your behalf.&nbsp;

It’s the listing agent’s job is to sell that home for the best price possible, so if you want to get the best deal possible for it, you need a buyer’s agent on your side. They’ll keep you informed through every step of the process and prevent you from making any decisions that will end up costing you. Additionally, they’ll be able to negotiate the best price and the best terms of your purchase.

There are still some situations where buyers think it’s a good idea to not have representation, and that’s when they come across an FSBO (For Sale By Owner) home. This still isn’t as good of an opportunity as you think, though. Why? Let’s say you find an FSBO home listed for $200,000 and discover that it’s appropriately priced. Do you still want to do all the work of completing the transaction without getting your money’s worth?&nbsp;

In reality, listing that $200,000 by themselves is saving the home seller about $12,000 in commission fees and another $1,500 in title fees. That’s why, by paying the full $200,000, you’re actually overpaying in addition to doing all the work.&nbsp;

To actually get a good deal in this example, you’d have to negotiate 6% off the purchase price and have the seller give you a discount for all the additional work you’ll have to do to ensure a clean title. The list of other things that can go wrong is too long to mention here, but if you do your homework, you’ll see why it’s so beneficial to have an agent by your side to help guide your through the transaction.

Granted, **not all agents provide the same level of service, so when you’re conducting your agent search, make sure you only interview those who do three to four deals a month.** This way, you know they’re actively learning throughout each sale or purchase.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this topic or you’re ready to get your home search started in the Austin area, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.<br>&nbsp;
