What’s happening in our Buda real estate market? To answer that question, let’s look at some key statistics from five different time periods between 1999 and now.&nbsp;

<u><strong>1999:</strong></u>

* Number of homes sold: 230
* Average price: $124,039
* Average price per square foot: $75
* The average days on market: 33 days

<u><strong>2004:</strong></u>

* Number of homes sold: 184
* Average price: $177,543
* Average price per square foot: $85
* The average days on market: 79 days

<u><strong>2009:</strong></u>

* Number of homes sold: 325
* Average price: $190,461
* Average price per square foot: $87
* The average days on market: 73 days

Remember, 2009 was in the heart of our economic downturn, but prices still went up compared to 2004. As home prices increased in Austin, people decided to migrate to neighboring cities and suburbs to find a more affordable cost of living, which brings us to our next year—notice the increase in home sales and the average price.

<u><strong>2014:</strong></u>&nbsp;

* Number of homes sold: 683
* Average price: $238,008
* Average price per square foot: $109
* The average days on market: 54 days

<u><strong>First half of 2019:</strong></u>

* Number of homes sold: 496
* Average price: $282,310
* Average price per square foot: $135
* The average days on market: 49 days

(Additionally, from 2004 to now, the average square footage of sold homes in Buda has been between 2,000 and 2,200 square feet.)

Note that the average price in 2019 is more than double what it was back in 1999. This is even after home sales took a dive for about four or five years. If you look at the average days on market for all time periods, you’ll notice that it hovers between one and two months, which makes us traditionally a strong seller’s market.&nbsp;
